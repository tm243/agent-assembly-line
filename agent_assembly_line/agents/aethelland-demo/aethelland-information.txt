Aethelland, a nation nestled amidst the jagged peaks of the Skyreach Mountains and bordered by the whispering Whisperwood Forest, is a land of stark contrasts and resilient people.  Its citizens, known as Aethelians, are a hardy folk, accustomed to the challenges of their rugged terrain.  They are renowned for their craftsmanship, particularly in metalworking and weaving, skills passed down through generations.  Aethelandic steel, forged in the heart of the Skyreach Mountains, is prized throughout the known world for its strength and durability.

The Aethelandic economy is largely agrarian, supplemented by the aforementioned craftsmanship.  Small, terraced farms cling to the mountainsides, producing hardy grains and root vegetables.  Trade is conducted primarily with neighboring settlements, with Aethelandic metalwork and woven textiles exchanged for goods that cannot be produced locally.  The discovery of rare mineral deposits in the Skyreach Mountains has recently brought a small influx of wealth, though this has also led to some tensions with neighboring clans eager to exploit these resources.

Geographically, Aethelland is dominated by the imposing Skyreach Mountains, a range of perpetually snow-capped peaks that form the nation's spine.  The Whisperwood Forest, a vast and ancient woodland, stretches along the western border, shrouded in mist and legend.  The climate is harsh, with long, cold winters and short, cool summers.  Rivers born in the high mountains carve deep valleys through the land, providing vital water sources for the scattered settlements.  These rivers eventually converge into the Great River Aethela, which flows southward and empties into the distant Azure Sea.

The history of Aethelland is one of resilience and survival.  For centuries, the Aethelians lived in scattered clans, constantly battling the elements and occasionally warring amongst themselves.  About two hundred years ago, a charismatic leader named Aerion united the clans under a single banner, forging the nation of Aethelland.  Aerion established a council of clan elders to govern the land, a system that continues to this day.  While Aethelland has enjoyed relative peace in recent decades, whispers of unrest are growing, fueled by disputes over resource control and the ambitions of rival clan leaders. The Aethelians, however, remain a proud and independent people, determined to preserve their unique culture and way of life in their challenging yet beautiful land.

The capital of the country of Aethelland is Aerion's Rest, named after the nation's unifier.  It's nestled in a sheltered valley near the confluence of three major rivers flowing from the Skyreach Mountains, a location chosen for its strategic importance and access to fresh water.

As for the population, estimating the number of citizens in Aethelland is tricky given its rugged terrain and scattered settlements.  A reasonable estimate would be around 300,000 citizens.  This accounts for the relatively low population density due to the challenging environment and the fact that many Aethelians live in small, isolated communities rather than concentrated urban centers.  Aerion's Rest, being the largest settlement, likely has a population of around 20,000.
