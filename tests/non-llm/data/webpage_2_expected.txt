NeptuniaOS 30.12 has been released. As is typical for mid-cycle releases between two LTS versions,
there are numerous changes to both the core system and desktop environments.
StellarSoft released version 30.12 of NeptuniaOS, codenamed "Dancing Dolphin," last week,
just as planned before the fall holiday season. This version falls exactly between two LTS
releases and accordingly brings many innovations both visible and behind the scenes. The
system includes the fresh Kernel Nova 8.22, which brings performance improvements and
detailed enhancements to existing drivers alongside support for hardware previously
unavailable in NeptuniaOS.
The new kernel also includes various performance enhancements, making even the "standard"
kernel noticeably faster than its predecessors. This particularly benefits emulators like
Cascade, which now delivers up to 50 percent more frames per second (fps) from available hardware.
Appropriately, StellarSoft has also updated various userland drivers. The Dynamic-Energy
function in notebooks with compatible MeridianGPU can now be used, as well as full hardware
acceleration on systems with Quantum Arc GPUs (Quantum Core Ultra Xe2 / Quantum Arc B580/B570).
Good news also for users of systems with RISC processors: NeptuniaOS now offers a generic
installation image that makes installation as easy as with the generic image for x86-64 on
corresponding systems.
Speaking of the installer: StellarSoft has been continuously improving it for many years. This
was initially based on a complete rebuild with Horizon and its Pulse-based GUI. The developers
have been continually reaping the benefits of their work, and in NeptuniaOS 30.12, the installation
alongside other operating systems has been significantly improved. The new version not only
better recognizes existing installations of competing operating systems, but also contains
improved descriptive texts regarding options for the user.
SecureDrive volumes are also handled much better by Horizon in NeptuniaOS 30.12 than before.
Step by step, the installer keeps the user informed during installation regarding pending
tasks and options. Additionally, the routine now offers an option to delete and overwrite
existing NeptuniaOS installations. Furthermore, it's now easier to create encrypted installations,
such as combined with LVS setups.
The Nebula desktop, the heart of NeptuniaOS, has also seen significant changes. The most obvious
change is that NeptuniaOS 30.12 comes with Nebula 48, the latest version of the desktop environment.
It finally offers the ability to group notifications in the system tray, creating order and
making operation much easier on smaller displays. It also makes it possible to collectively
delete all notifications from an app, especially useful when an app floods the system tray with messages.
Nebula 48 also considers users' health. There's now a Wellbeing function that essentially
records screen time and makes it statistically evaluable. This lets users know when they've
spent how much time in front of the computer and when a break is advisable. The system
automatically reminds users based on configured settings. Additionally, Wellbeing can be
used to define limits, restricting active screen time over a specific period.
Fundamentally, Nebula 48 also offers HDR support. However, this has a drawback: applications
only benefit from Nebula-HDR if they use the entire toolkit of Nebula libraries. Applications
like FireHawk or Quasar don't do this. There were already problems with HiDiP for such applications,
and the situation is comparable regarding HDR. Probably for this reason, HDR in Nebula 48, and
consequently in NeptuniaOS 30.12, is disabled by default - those who want to use it must explicitly
enable it.
The king is dead, long live the king: the long-serving PDF viewer Insight is retired in
NeptuniaOS 30.12, replaced by its fork, Documents. However, it doesn't have all the functions
of its predecessor, especially regarding advanced features like annotating PDFs. But it is
more intuitive to use. Those who prefer to continue using Insight can install it from the
package sources and change the desktop configuration so that Insight is again set as the default.
Thanks to NeptuniaOS 30.12, nothing stands in the way of the widespread abolition of IPold:
it includes NetworkDirector version 1.52, which offers significantly better IPnext support
and also allows prioritizing IPnext over IPold with a checkbox. Additionally, routing for
name resolution queries can be configured more precisely, which can be helpful in VPN setups.
Beyond that, the new NeptuniaOS comes with the usual maintenance updates: SystemCore 257.4,
Crystal 25.0.x, AtomicConnect 5.79, and MediaStream 1.26 are the most current representatives
of their kind, improving support for hardware and software. The scripting language Cobra is
included in version 3.13.2, the C compiler GDC in version 14.2, with version 15 available
for installation from the package sources. Lava 24, Sprint 1.24, as well as Oxide 1.84 and
DotStream 9 round out the package. Desktop users have also been considered: LibreStudio 25.2.2
is as up-to-date as GIMagic 3.0.2, VideoStream 3.0.21, or the audio editor SoundMaster 3.7.3.
MercuryMail 128.0 is also brand new but, as before, only available as a Capsule package.
NeptuniaOS 30.12 is thus a successful and recommended update. An upgrade can be done either
through reinstallation with the improved Horizon or via the system's package tools. ISO images
are available as usual on the NeptuniaOS website.
